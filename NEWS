mavlink-router 2
================
    - Misc bug fixes on handling error handling paths and general cleanups
    - Log file is now changed to read-only when we are not saving flight stack
      log anymore
    - New "LogMode" configuration to allow logging only when armed
    - MavlinkDialect now defaults to "auto": we set it based on the flight stack:
      either ArduPilot or PX4
    - Fix logging from vehicles with systemd ID not equal 1. We will now get the
      system ID from the first message heartbeat received with MAV_COMP_ID_AUTOPILOT1
      component ID
    - Gracefully handle restarts, to reuse the same IP/port.
    - Gracefully handle errors when the UART device disappears (e.g. when disconnecting
      a USB-serial dongle)
    - Make mavlink-router compatible with musl libc
    - Tweak USB-serial configuration to ask Linux to reduce the latency
    - Add "Filter" configuration to endpoints: this allows endpoints to declare interest
      in only a subset of messages by specifying the message IDs. This allows reducing the
      the link traffic and thus mixing for e.g. low bandwidth links in a high bandwith
      network
    - We now plunge a background sync() call every 1 second when logging to avoid losing
      log data - default OS configuration in Linux is 30 seconds.
    - Always check CRC of the messages arriving independently of the link (UDP vs UART).
      Previously we would skip checking on UDP because the network layer guarantees we
      aren't receiving garbage and it's expected to have 1 message per packet. However
      we don't enforce the 1 message per packet and the source of the message
      could be unintentionally sending garbage when, for example it relays
      messages from other lossy links.
    - New MinFreeSpace and MaxLogFiles configuration to control logging maximum size
      and rotation

mavlink-router 1
================

    - Route mavlink messages between endpoints
    - Support UART and UDP endpoints for flight stack (both ArduPilot and PX4)
      and UART, UDP and TCP endpoints for other components
    - TCP endpoints are automatically added/removed upon connection
    - Save flight stack logs for ArduPilot (binlog) and PX4 (ulog)
    - Minimal/opportunistic parsing on MAVLink messages to avoid overhead
